Its main objective is to offer effective and adaptable tools for carrying out logical and mathematical operations on huge datasets. Because NumPy arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations, they minimize overhead and offer vectorized operations—processing complete arrays at once rather than one element at a time—which allow for faster computations than ordinary Python lists.\n",
